Taskify
==================================

Hey there! Excited about joining the Taskify Mobile Team? We're thrilled to welcome you!

First things first, take a deep breath. Our aim throughout the interview process is to build a connection â€” for us to learn about you and for you to understand our team. We want this to be an enjoyable learning experience for everyone. In programming, there are no strict "right answers"; it's about navigating challenges through thoughtful compromises. Mistakes happen, and that's perfectly okay; we all make them.

Now, onto your second assignment: share some beautiful code samples with us. It'll give us a great starting point for our delightful discussion. If you've got a project you're proud of, we'd love to see it. If not, no worries! We've prepared an interesting task for you to tackle. Let's make this journey enjoyable and insightful!

## The challenge

Introducing TaskifyPix, an exciting project where you'll create a Flutter app to showcase Flickr pictures! Instead of providing boilerplate code, we're giving you a blank canvas to express your creativity ðŸŽ¨ Your assignment is to build the app from scratch, transforming it into a captivating picture-browsing experience. While we'll offer some tips, we intentionally keep the requirements open, reflecting our mobile team's ethos. We have guidelines, but team members are encouraged to introduce improvements across the app.

Importantly, we're not seeking to compare or grade projects; instead, we aim to understand you better. We prioritize quality over quantity, respecting your valuable time. Feel free to focus on infusing creativity and thoughtful enhancements into the project. Let's embark on an exciting journey to explore your Flutter skills!

### Interface

we don't *"assign grades"* based on the time you invest in designing and polishing UI, so there's no need to dwell on that. What matters most to us is the tidiness of the UI â€“ think equal padding, a logical widget hierarchy, and well-defined layout constraints. We value a clean and organized presentation that enhances user experience. Focus on the structural aspects, ensuring a well-organized and visually pleasing layout. Your attention to detail in maintaining a tidy UI is what we're keenly interested in.

### Architecture

â€¢ Ensure adherence to SOLID principles.

â€¢ Implement error handling with alert or toast views.

â€¢ Feel free to leverage any third-party libraries.

â€¢ Design the project for easy unit testing, including at least one unit test.


### Requirements

â€¢ Design a vertical feed with one picture per row

â€¢ Each item in the feed should display the image and the image's title

â€¢ The project should implement pagination for the pictures feed

â€¢ Allow users to tap on pictures in the feed to preview them in fullscreen.

â€¢ Incorporate loading indicators to inform users during feed loading.

â€¢ Ensure the main feed is reloadable through a pull-to-refresh control.

### Send us your work!
